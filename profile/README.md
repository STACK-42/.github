# About
Welcome to **Stack42**, the proving/experimental playground for our hackathon adventures! We're a band of undergrad freshers and one _"wise"_ recent grad who are still figuring things out.
This organization is where we test our apps and collaborate on projects. Join us in exploring the future of development, one project at a time.

## Repositories
Here's a list of our open-source repositories:

- [Cphorm](https://github.com/STACK-42/Cphorm) This is the main repository where the different parts of the solution are documented and submoduled. 
- [Cphrom_API](https://github.com/STACK-42/Cphorm_be) This is the backend API for the Cphrom Project
- [Cphorm_fe](https://github.com/STACK-42/Cphorm_fe#) The Frontend and Dashboard for Cphorm Project
